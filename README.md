ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Chris here!
---

I am a hobbyist software engineer & web developer. I am currently interested in UI & UX design. In addition, I'm experimenting with artificial intelligence (and that can create some pretty cool stuff!)

ðŸ‘€ My experiments range from deepfakes to sequence prediction (in games), from marking open-ended questions (as passed/failed) to using GPT-3 in helpdesk scenarios. It's great to see its capabilities!

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning the ins & outs of vue.js. I've been using it more and more; it's honestly efficacious.

ðŸ“« If you would like to contact me, you can send a request to **xChris_vC#1234** on Discord!
