👋 Hi, Chris here!
---

I am a hobbyist software engineer & web developer. 

⚙️ Currently working with HTML+CSS, JavaScript (+ node.js), Python and C#. 

🌱 I'm currently learning the ins & outs of React and Vue. I've been using it more and more; it's honestly efficacious.

📫 If you would like to contact me, you can send a request to **xChris_vC#1234** on Discord!
